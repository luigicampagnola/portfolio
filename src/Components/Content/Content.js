    p1: `My name is Luigi Campagnola. I was born in Honduras and recently moved to Perugia, Italy. I started learning web development back in 2018. I was looking to learn something new and couldn't figure out what it was. In 2018, I read an article posted on a Slack channel on my previous job. The article talked about the best careers to be at, so I got interested in coding and started learning at freecodecamp.org. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some AngularJS, but I got burn out due to the amount of content I was learning and left it for a while. In 2019, I read a couple of books on careers and self-learning and got a more stable job. In 2019, I bought a Udemy course called 'Learn to Learn'; my teacher was, by coincidence, a senior web developer with a great community of developers on his Discord channel.`,

    p2: `When I finished his Learn to Learn course, I was already part of his students' community of programming students and senior developers. 
    That's when I started to get interested in programming again and started his course: The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery. 
    I worked with other students and participated in monthly coding challenges made by our community. I started building some projects based on others' ideas with help from the community, and it quickly became a passion. 
    I started using React and adding APIs to my projects and quickly began to love this career. 
    My goal is to help create scalable apps and websites and continue learning new things. I want to work with a team and a great company that shares my desire for continuous growth.`,
